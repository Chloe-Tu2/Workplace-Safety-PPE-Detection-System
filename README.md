## 💡 Midterm Project Proposal: [Tier 1, 2, or 3]

*This is the official project proposal, serving as the required documentation for the midterm submission.*

### The Problem
[2-3 sentences describing the real-world problem you're solving.]

**Who Cares:** [e.g., Warehouse managers, farmers, doctors]
**Why Important:** [e.g., Saves $X in labor, increases accuracy by Y%]

### The Solution
[1-2 sentences describing your system and what it will do to solve the problem.]

### Technical Approach
* **CV Technique:** [Object Detection / Classification / Segmentation / VLM/etc.]
* **Model:** [YOLOV8 / ResNet50 / CLIP/etc.]
* **Framework:** [PyTorch / TensorFlow / Hugging Face]
* **Why this approach:** [1-2 sentences explaining your model choice.]

### Dataset
